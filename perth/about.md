# About

The Research Bazaar (ResBaz) is a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy emerging at the centre of modern research, with events held at a number of university campuses around the globe.

Perth's ResBaz is a multi-day intensive festival and (un-)conference where researchers come together to up-skill in next generation digital research tools and scholarship. In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun. 

In light of the ever-evolving COVID-19 developments, the program organising committee has decided to run a **virtual** ResBaz throughout the week of June 28 2021.

You can either join our **[mailing list](https://forms.gle/2eXLRw4qnHQkXjB49)** or follow us on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ResBazPerth)** to stay up-to-date.

Researchers at all levels from all disciplines. PhD and research Masters students are especially encouraged to apply. Research technologists who support researchers to do their job should also come along!

ResBaz is particularly aimed at those new to digital research tools. To hear from trainers and participants of the 2019 ResBaz Perth, watch the 'ResBaz testimonials' video below!
