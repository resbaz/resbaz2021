# About

The Research Bazaar (ResBaz) is a worldwide festival promoting the digital literacy emerging at the centre of modern research, with events held at a number of university campuses around the globe.

Perth's ResBaz is a multi-day intensive festival and (un-)conference where researchers come together to up-skill in next generation digital research tools and scholarship. In the spirit of a marketplace or bazaar, ResBaz is a highly participatory event where researchers from many different disciplines can learn, share knowledge and skills, and have fun. 

In light of the ever-evolving COVID-19 developments, the program organising committee has decided to run a **virtual** ResBaz throughout the week of June 28 2021. UPDATE: [New ResBaz Perth 2021 WebSite is now live! Please click here for all event details](https://curtinids.github.io/ResBazPerth2021/)
